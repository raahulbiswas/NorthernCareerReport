          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
	  	In the northern territories specifically North West Territories there are a small number of software development, web development and system analyst positions available for computer science graduates. As more and more things become digitized, skilled developers and analysts are required to update the territories and provide support and update local businesses. 
	  </p> 
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the possible companies a web developer could work for is Outcrop.  They are a large marketing and web development company that is dedicated to market and build websites for local businesses across the three territories and is always on the look to expand and hire talented web developers. 
      </p> 
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
	Other possible career opportunities can be for the Northwest government to work with databases and server as a System analyst. Health and other records require organization and computers are an excellent way to securely store and organize records for ease of use. In order for this system to be built, maintained and the appropriate programs written to take full advantage of the information, developers and system analysts need to be hired. 
	  </p> 
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
Due to a lack of computer science training available in the north, skilled computer scientists and developers must be brought in from the south thus decreasing local competition and allowing for better job security.

      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      
      <hr>
     
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  When considering a job opportunity in the north, one must consider the challenges they must face when living and working in this new setting. The most obvious challenge that must be considered by anyone visiting the North is the difference in climate. Temperatures can average as low as -27 degrees Celsius and heavy snowfall is commonly expected. Therefore, anyone who is not comfortable in cold climates would clearly be required to reconsider if this career opportunity is actually worth months of even years of discomfort. 
	  </p> 
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Another challenge is the high living expense due to limited accessibility of goods from the south. A higher salary may seem tempting however if the overall living expenses are much greater it may work out to be less profitable. 
      </p> 
      <p>
         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  If professional development is an important factor in the employees career goals than the north would disappoint in that area as well. With small populations being a factor, large options in educational institutions and programs are not an option. When it comes to computer science the only similarly related program one could expand their skills would be a Computer Systems Technician program offered at Nunavut Arctic College, however that focuses more on maintenance and IT than actual software and web development.  There is also a lack of professional conferences, workshops and events to allow individuals to network and further develop their skill set so the only real opportunity one could have to learn would be from the working experience. 
	  </p> 
      <p>
	  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Social challenges such as high visibility and lack of privacy must be taken into consideration as well. Due to smaller communities in a north many members of the community are well aware of all happenings of their community and its members. This can be seen a positive in some ways however it leads to the majority of the community being aware of your profession and your daily tasks and personal activities, which to some may be a privacy concern. 
	  </p> 
        
        <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    Another social challenge would be dealing with alcohol and the issues with alcoholism in the north. Unfortunately a large portion of residents in the north take part in excessive drinking leading to more alcohol related issues such as public intoxication and driving under the influence. This can be seen as a safety concern and a deal breaker especially for those who are strongly against the consumption of alcoholic beverages

      <h1>North versus South</h1>
      
      <hr>
     
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
	When comparing the jobs available in the northern part of Canada with the jobs available within southern Canada, a larger variety is available in the south. Larger technology companies such as Facebook, Google, Blackberry, Samsungâ€¦etc.  all have offices in the south in locations such as Toronto and Mississauga however none in the North. Most of the computer science related jobs are for companies that are either local or government jobs. 
	  </p> 
      <p>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
	However, the salaries offered for the same positions but in the North are significantly higher. For example, an average system analyst in Ontario makes about $63,778 annually. A job posting for a system analyst position for the Northwest Government offered over $84,494 plus an the annual Northern Allowance of $3,450
Salary is offered on top of the annual salary.  Another example is comparing web developers. Web developers in Ontario earn a median of 48,950 while a posting by a company in The North West Territories is $66,000.

      </p> 
      <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
The number of jobs is also significantly different. Since there are larger companies and more companies, there is more than ten times the amount of jobs for computer scientists available in the South in comparison to the North.
